Why Our Ads Are Different

Most online advertising is built around tracking people.

Ours is built around places and moments.

That difference matters.

⸻

Ads based on where, not who

On Loxation, ads are shown based on the location of a post or conversation, not on personal profiles, browsing history, or identity graphs.

If you’re viewing posts tied to a specific area, you may see ads from:
	•	Local businesses nearby
	•	Events happening in that area
	•	Services relevant to that place and moment

We don’t build behavioral profiles.
We don’t follow you across the web.
We don’t sell personal data.

Ads appear because of context, not because of you.

⸻

Designed for local relevance, not surveillance

Traditional digital ads try to predict what you might want someday.

Our ads show up when:
	•	A conversation is happening right now
	•	In a specific place
	•	Around a shared local context

That makes ads feel:
	•	Useful instead of creepy
	•	Timely instead of repetitive
	•	Relevant instead of generic

Think less “targeted advertising”
and more digital signage for real places.

⸻

Limited by design

We intentionally limit advertising on Loxation:
	•	A small number of ad placements per feed
	•	Clearly labeled “Sponsored” content
	•	No auto-playing videos
	•	No feed flooding

Ads should support the community — not overwhelm it.

⸻

No cross-site tracking

We do not:
	•	Track you across other apps or websites
	•	Build shadow profiles
	•	Use third-party data brokers
	•	Run invasive fingerprinting scripts

What happens on Loxation stays on Loxation.

⸻

Better for communities

Because ads are tied to places, not people:
	•	Communities stay focused on conversation
	•	Moderation stays simpler and more transparent
	•	Trust stays intact

Advertising never influences:
	•	Post visibility
	•	User reputation
	•	Community rules

⸻

Better for local businesses

For advertisers, this means:
	•	Reach people already engaged with a place
	•	Promote events, pop-ups, and time-sensitive offers
	•	No complex targeting setup
	•	No learning phase
	•	No tracking pixels required

You advertise where something is happening, not who someone is.

⸻

Our principle

We monetize locations and moments — not identities.

That principle shapes every ad decision we make.

If we can’t explain an ad simply and honestly to our users,
we don’t run it.
