        <h2>About Your community</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Your community</strong> is a platform for connecting with people nearby. We help you discover and engage with others in your local area.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether you're looking to meet neighbors, find local events, or simply see what's happening around you — Your community makes it easy to stay connected.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Browse nearby posts</strong> — See what's happening in your area, sorted by location and time.</li>
          <li><strong>Search by location</strong> — Enter a city or address to find posts from that area.</li>
          <li><strong>Search by username</strong> — Use @username to find all posts from a specific person.</li>
          <li><strong>Reply via the app</strong> — Download the Loxation app to respond to posts privately.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Privacy First</h3>

        <p>
          We believe in privacy. Posts are public but replies are private. You control what you share and who you connect with. Location data is anonymized to a general area — we never share exact coordinates. You can also type in an address.
        </p>
        <h3>Why the Loxation app?</h3>
        <p>Without a way to verify the person you think you are chatting with, it's challenging to ensure genuine connections and maintain privacy. The Loxation app provides a secure platform for posting and replying.
            Chatting on the web was great until bots started creating fake profiles and AI has only worsened this. Scammers made the online world unsafe. The <b>Loxation</b> app ensures that the person on the other end of the chat has a phone with a single account, not a bot farm, and if you eventually meet that person it tells you that the person you are meeting is the person you've been chatting with, or the person you've been chatting with is a real person that you've been in proximity with. That is real in person verification.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Get the App</h3>
